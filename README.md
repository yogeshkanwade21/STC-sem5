## Abstract
Fruit classification is a challenging process which
 has always been done manually. We can
 try to create an automatic fruit categorization system using machine learning. Fruits have an uneven
 shape, a wide range of sizes, and a diversity of colours, making it difficult to identify. However,
 developing an efficient classification system will counter these difficulties. Such systems can be
 further improved to do the task of fruit grading along with fruit classification.

## Motivation
* Smart Agriculture
* Reducing labor cost
* Time saving approach
* Helping producers and businesses to grow

## Modules Used
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* Tensorflow

## Proposed Architecture

## Conclusion
* loss: 1.2458
* accuracy: 0.8833
* System can be further improved to perform the task of fruit grading and fruit disease detection along with fruit classification.
